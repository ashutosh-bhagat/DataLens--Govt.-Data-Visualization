## Project Overview

The DataLens project focuses on creating interactive visualizations for government-related data. The goal is to make complex datasets more accessible and understandable, facilitating data-driven decision-making and analysis.

## Datasets Used

The project utilizes several datasets, including but not limited to:

- **Annual Temperature.csv**: Contains annual temperature records.
- **Education_Schemes.csv**: Details various educational schemes.
- **Gujarat.csv**: Specific data related to the state of Gujarat.
- **Pollutant and State.csv**: Information on pollutants across different states.
- **State Vs Crop Production.csv**: Data comparing crop production across states.
- **State_GDP_Education.csv**: GDP and education-related statistics by state.
- **Union_Budget.csv**: Data pertaining to the union budget.

## Notebooks

The project includes Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and visualization:

- **Agriculture.ipynb**: Analysis and visualization of agricultural data.
- **Economics.ipynb**: Insights into economic indicators and trends.
- **Education.ipynb**: Examination of educational data and schemes.
- **Environment.ipynb**: Visualization of environmental data, including pollutants.
- **App.ipynb**: Main application notebook integrating various analyses.
